# What to Do When the Other Driver Turned Left in Front of You But Their Insurance Tries to Blame You – Salt Lake City, UT

You’re driving straight through an intersection with the right of way. Another driver turns left across your lane—and you crash. It should be clear who’s at fault. But the other driver’s insurance company is **trying to shift the blame onto you.**

This is a common insurance tactic in Utah. This guide explains how to fight back, prove fault, and preserve your claim under Utah law.

## Key Legal Rule

### Utah Code § 41-6a-903(1)
> “The operator of a vehicle intending to turn to the left... shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction... which is so close as to constitute an immediate hazard.”

**Translation:** In Utah, the driver turning left must yield. If they hit you while you're going straight, they are **presumptively at fault**.

## Insurance Tactics to Watch For

Insurance adjusters will often attempt to:
- Argue that you were “speeding”
- Claim you had time to stop
- Say you contributed to the crash
- Insist the other driver “couldn’t see you coming”
- Demand proportionate fault be assigned (comparative fault under Utah Code § 78B-5-818)

These are **standard liability minimization tactics** used to reduce or deny your settlement.

## What You Must Do Immediately

### Step 1: Request the Police Report
- If officers responded, request the full crash report with diagrams and witness notes.
- Look for citations or fault determinations under § 41-6a-903.

### Step 2: Collect Intersection Evidence
- **Locate traffic cameras, doorbell cams, or nearby surveillance**
- Use **Google Street View** to mark the sightline and turn lane positions
- **Measure skid marks or vehicle resting positions**, if preserved

### Step 3: Preserve Vehicle Damage Photos
- The **location of impact** on both vehicles tells a story
- Front-end damage to your car + side-impact to theirs = typical left-turn fault
- Use annotated photos and timestamps if available

### Step 4: Get Witness Statements ASAP
- Neutral witnesses carry more weight than driver statements
- Ask bystanders to give written or recorded statements on what they saw

### Step 5: Create a Collision Timeline
Use your memory, GPS records, dashcam footage, and call logs to reconstruct:

| Event              | Time     | Notes                              |
|--------------------|----------|------------------------------------|
| Green light / entry| HH:MM AM |                                    |
| Point of impact    | HH:MM AM | Sudden left turn without signal    |
| Police arrival     | HH:MM AM |                                    |

## Sample Script to Use With Adjusters

> “The left-turn driver failed to yield in violation of Utah Code § 41-6a-903. I was proceeding straight with the right of way. Unless you can produce independent evidence that rebuts this presumption of fault, you are legally obligated to accept liability and pay damages.”

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can they still deny the claim even if their insured was turning left?**  
Yes, but you can rebut their denial using vehicle damage, scene photos, witnesses, and applicable statutes. Most denials are bluff leverage.

**Q: What if there’s no police report?**  
You can still prove fault through vehicle damage, dashcam footage, and eye-witnesses. Self-document everything. Consider filing your own crash statement with SLCPD.

**Q: Will they try to claim I was speeding?**  
Yes. But unless they have **radar, expert analysis, or witness support**, it’s speculative and legally insufficient.

**Q: Can they split fault under comparative negligence?**  
Only if they have **admissible evidence** that you were partly at fault. You remain entitled to recovery unless your fault exceeds 50%.

## Tactical Tips to Strengthen Your Case

- **Immediately hire a collision reconstructionist** if there is major damage or injury
- **Request cell phone records** to show you were not distracted
- Use **vehicle black box data** (EDR) to show your speed and braking
- Submit a **written statement with annotated intersection map** when filing your claim
- Keep all communication **in writing** with adjusters

Request the crash report  
 Document the intersection and damage  
 Lock in witness statements  
 Cite Utah Code § 41-6a-903 in all communications
